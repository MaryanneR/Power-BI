# Power BI
These pdf versions of Power BI projects showcase my knowledge of the various functions of Power BI, including connecting to and using various data sources, such as csv and Excel files, SQL databases, web scraping from various websites, and JSON APIs, as well as advanced data cleaning using DAX and PowerQuery. These cleaned datasets were then used to create beautiful and functional data visualizations using Power Bi's built-in visualization features as well as Python and R scripts. 

This repository contains pdf versions of Power BI projects I worked on as coursework for the Complete Microsoft Power BI Bootcamp course offered by Nikolai Schuler and Ligency I Team hosted on Udemy.
